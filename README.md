## Usage

```
Usage of ./blaezi:
  -secure
        Secure connection.
  -tests string
        Complete path to the tests. (default "test.json")
  -timeout int
        Timeout for client. (default 5)
```

## Tests:

A test can be specified using JSON. `url` and `status_code` are necessary, `content` is optional.

Here is a sample test:

```json
[
    {
      "url": "/",
      "status_code": 200,
      "content": "Hello!"
    },
    {
      "url": "/posts",
      "status_code": 200,
      "content": "Hello post!"
    },
    {
      "url": "/nonexistent",
      "status_code": 404
    }
]
```


## Example

With the test specified above we can run `blaezi` like:

```
./blaezi http://localhost:8080 -tests test.json
```

If you want to specify a timeout for 10 seconds, you can do so by:

```
./blaezi http://localhost:8080 -tests test.json -timeout 10
```
